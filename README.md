# Project3

Description

The Atlanta comedy scene is a thriving scene with many venues and many open mic opportunities, however it is very difficult to find out where and when these shows are unless you follow specific comedians on social media. Comedy Tracker is a user sourced site that will allow people to track what comedy shows and open mics are coming to atlanta with information on ticket purchasing and venue location.

Deployed App:

The technologies I used in this project are: Node, express, mongoose, React, styled-components, Moment.js, axios, nodemon, concurrently.

In version 2 I would like to add multiple cities to be tracked, pull from the Google calendar API to easily pull open mics, add passport for user authentication, sessions, and the ability to favorite shows so that they show up on an individual users page.
